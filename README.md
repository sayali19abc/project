Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar  to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). 
In our project for Clustering the k means clustering is used. K means clustering is used for creating 'k' number of clusters. In our dataset of statistics of batsmens we are applying these algorithm for selected columns and all rows.On the basis of this we are creating clusters. And at the end dataset is visualized by using different parameters. Histogram, Box Plot, Scatter Matrix is created  .
